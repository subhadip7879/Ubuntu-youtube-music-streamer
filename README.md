#### About 
This application streams music from youtube with the help of a webbrowser.Note that the webbrowser is simply hidden.Thus in reality the video is also being streamed, but is hidden.The application takes extensive help from Youtube-API and uses selenium web scrapping module.The GUI has been built using tkinter, python's standard GUI development module.As such the application window is "liberated" or there is no title or menu bar, therefore always stays on top of all applications being run at the same time.The window can be dragged simply by clicking and dragging on any empty part of the window, except on and near the "SJ" label.You can quit the application by clicking on or near the "SJ" label.
There is a lot of scope for the application's improvement like performance and GUI.A proper desktop widget ( that sticks on the ubuntu desktop ) will be soon launched taking help of pyGTK's bindings.An executable file for the same will be released soon.

#### Buid Instructions:
    Open terminal.
    Navigate to the directory where the .py file has been saved.
    python3 music_edm.py
    Enjoy!!
